# 🎥 Movie Recommendation System  

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System**! This project is a streamlined application that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It leverages **cosine similarity** for recommendation accuracy and uses **Streamlit** to provide an intuitive user interface.

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a seamless and interactive experience.  
- **Accurate Recommendations**: Utilizes **cosine similarity** to suggest movies based on user input.  
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Implements **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data preprocessing and manipulation.  
- **Real-Time Performance**: Quick and accurate movie recommendations in real-time.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Core programming language.  
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.  
- **Pandas**: For data processing and analysis.  
- **Cosine Similarity**: To calculate similarity between movie features.  
- **Streamlit**: For building the frontend.
